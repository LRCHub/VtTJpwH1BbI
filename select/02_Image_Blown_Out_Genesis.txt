People moving about the town upside down, you know why
Little bits of coloured glass in the sky
Children pushing mummy down to the park in a pram
Look out – the pavement's changing to jam

Your bowler hats are turning green
Your city suits are coloured cream
You, you changed my life
You made it misery, sadness reins alone
Wonder why you do this to me
When I've tried so hard for you

People talking to the man who's digging a hole in his mind
He's no need to worry, he's deaf and blind
See the dustman doing his round in a Rolls made of glass
He's gained everything because he's got class

Your bowler hats are turning green
Your city suits are coloured cream
You, you changed my life
You made it misery, sadness reins alone
Wonder why you do this to me
When I've tried so hard for you

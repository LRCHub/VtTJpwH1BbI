I wanna crystallize
Every single thought behind your naked eyes
So I can refer to them later
And sing louder, just to hear my naked voice above this guitar
It is too complex to make it out

I wanna be had in a way that makes me feel alive

I need to understand
Your brilliant thing, it's swirling your bones
Make a man of me and I'll answer them
I'm fifteen now
Imagining cold hands and then I run in house
This is more comfy than previously

You make me wanna be had in a way that makes me feel alive

Ive got your image, in the middle of my mind
And every single time, it's make ne very high.
Two lovely people, we get to know ourselves,
So much better than we felt and better the rest.
Oh why, we love when love like we do
But i do i do i do feel so satisfied
Answer 2 questions that we never knew,
That finally come true with you.
Ive got your image, its we're walking down
The street and all the people meet
Are dressed so very neat...
You said i love you, so ask just you felt
About kids and wedding bells
And i life thtat could be shared...
I try to show and i hope i would goof
But the puddin is the proof, please
Give me a try...
I know i love you, yes i always wil
Until the end is seal...
Im stand to say, thay i love always
Because i love you because i love you...

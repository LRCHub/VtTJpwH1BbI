I only lied like I did cause I didn't wanna hurt you no.
I never meant to break your heart kid.
I swear tonight no white could hide this blue.
I can feel my veins splitting into two.
Pieces never colliding again.
Don't hold your tongue love, even the score.
Destination my bed check your cloths at the door.
You're only using me
I feel so used and useless
I never found you in my arms tonight, and I never will
How long until I see the end?
Go back again to the day that I was born.
When I crept into this world with naked eyes only to find
That there's no turning back
Let's get something straight, there's nothing wrong
Just hold on
The pain has stopped, the sun's come up
Just hold on
The night can show the pain that I've brought on you.
The moon shows its silent grin
This haven's all I know.
The garden of eden is my sanctuary
I'd rather be yours
I've been up for days.
And still I can't find
No more or no less piece of mind.
Till' the day that I was born
I crept into this world with naked eyes only to find
That there's no turning back
That I'm on my own
Just hold on

I'm fallin'
I'm callin'
Out here on the edge
You don't hear me
Nowhere near me
Has the last word been said
My lonely gaze-
Lost your sweet protection
No more days-
Of wearin' your reflection
NAKED EYES
Stripped of you
They wear lonely tears tonight
NAKED EYES
Faded blue
Watchin you fall out of love and out of sight

No reason
You're just leavin'
And I hate to see you cry
You wave to me
Look right through me
Was this whole world a lie
Broken dreams-
Live on as a nightmare
Every scene
Plays on without you there

Thinkin' all night of what we did right
Won't change goodbye
You're the memory
I'm just a bad dream
Woke yourself up and wiped me out of your eyes
